# String Reversal and Concatenation

This code is designed to reverse three input strings and concatenate them. Initially, it defines three strings (`S`, `St`, and `Str`) with predefined values. It then defines a function `Strings` that takes three strings as input, reverses each one, and concatenates them. The function is first called with the predefined strings to demonstrate its functionality.

Next, the code prompts the user to input three strings (`S`, `St`, and `Str`). It then calls the `Strings` function again with these user-provided strings and prints the reversed and concatenated result.

## Key Points

- **String Reversal**: The function `Strings` reverses each input string using slicing (`[::-1]`).
- **Concatenation**: The reversed strings are concatenated to form a single output string.
- **User Input**: The code collects three strings from the user and processes them using the same function.
